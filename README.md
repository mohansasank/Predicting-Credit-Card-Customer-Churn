# Predicting-Credit-Card-Customer-Churn
Minimizing customer churn is a central priority for businesses, as retaining high-value 
accounts represents a critical driver of profitability and marketing effectiveness. 
Companies recognize existing customers as a vital asset, underscoring the strategic 
importance of customer retention - a core tenet of Customer Relationship Management. 
This study aims to identify the machine learning model exhibiting optimal predictive 
performance for forecasting credit card customer churn. By leveraging a customer 
purchasing behavior dataset, the analysis will extract meaningful insights and knowledge 
through rigorous data preprocessing and the application of predictive data mining 
techniques. The goal is to comparatively evaluate various machine learning algorithms to 
select the model best suited for accurate churn forecasting. 
Proactive retention strategies informed by the optimal predictive model can enable the 
organization to minimize customer attrition, thereby maximizing profitability. This data
driven approach to understanding and responding to customer churning behavior 
represents a crucial competency in the contemporary business landscape dominated by 
intense competition and evolving consumer preferences.
